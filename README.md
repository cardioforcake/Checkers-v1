## Capture
##### To capture a piece of your opponent, your piece leaps over one of the ##### opponent's pieces and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. This landing square must be empty.
##### When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
##### Only one piece may be captured in a single jump, but multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.
##### If a player is able to make the capture, then the jump must be made.
##### If more than one capture is available, then the player decides which capture he prefers to make.

## Upgrade a piece to a King
##### When a piece reaches the furthest row, it is crowned and becomes a king.
##### Kings are limited to moving diagonally but can move both forward and backward.
