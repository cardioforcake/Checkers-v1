# Rules of Checkers

#### Important Rule: If a player is able to make the capture, then the jump must be made.

## Game Play
Checkers is played by two players.
Each player begins the game with 12 discs and places them on the 12 dark squares closest to him or her.
Red opens the game, then players alternate their turns.

## Move
The pieces always move diagonally and single pieces are always limited to forward moves.
A piece making a non-capturing move may move only one square.

## Capture
To capture a piece of your opponent, your piece leaps over one of the opponent's pieces and lands in a straight diagonal line on the other side. This landing square must be empty.
When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.
Only one piece may be captured in a single jump, but multiple jumps are allowed on a single turn.
If a player is able to make the capture, then the jump must be made.
If more than one capture is available, then the player decides which capture he prefers to make.

## Upgrade a piece to a King
When a piece reaches the furthest row, it is crowned and becomes a king.
Kings are limited to moving diagonally but can move both forward and backward.
